# Sewer_Maintenance
Based on paper “RISK-BASED PRIORITIZATION FOR SEWER MAINTENANCE AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS” by Michael Flores, Joanne Siew, and Jonathan Lee.  

Risk is defined in the paper as Likelihood x Consequence, this is usually called exposure X hazard.  

## Consequence:
The consequence score quantifies what areas a sewer system overflow (SSO) would be the most detrimental to the community.  The model uses the size of the sewer system (SS) lines as an indication of the amount of material that could potentially be spilled by that line.  Larger spill require more time and man power to clean, so is given a 30% weight.   The distance to the streams is given the greatest weight for the consequence score with 40%.   If a SSO reaches the water ways it must be reported to the state and could increase oversite of the city by TCEQ.  Although impact to commuters is a minor consideration with a weight of only 10 % it is worth including because of its high visibility to the greater community. 
the proximity of the SS to different land use types.  

## Likelihood:
The likelihood score quantifies the lines that have a greater likelihood of presenting a problem.  The model used the age of the lines, the values of the homes around the SS lines, the historic routine maintenance (RM) data, and the historic work order (WO) information.  The WOs that are used are the public sewer stops as a result of debris, grease, and roots and the public SSOs as a result of capacity, pipe failure, pump station failure, debris, grease, and roots.
