## Configuration instructions
This script utilizes the ArcPy functions.  Shapefiles, layers, and attribute names will need to be adjusted to reflect the user’s data. 
The script is set up to be used in an ArcGIS toolbox.  Before you use the script it will need to be saved to an ArcGIS toolbox.  

###Step 1. Create toolbox
If you do not already have a personal tool box you will need to add one.  In AcrMap or ArcCatalog go to the AcrToolbox window.

Right click on the white space and select Add Toolbox…

This opens the browsing dialog box.  If you have a pre-existing toolbox you can add it to your map this way or brows to the location where you would like your toolbox to be stored and create a new toolbox in this location.  Use the create toolbox button at the top right hand corner of the dialog box and name the file something unique to you.

###Step 2. Add script to toolbox
To add the script as a tool that can be used like any other tool in ArcMap right click on the appropriate toolbox.  Navigate to Add, hovering over Add will bring up more option.  Click on Script.

The dialog box will allow you to name the script and provide descriptive information that can be used to remind you and others in your organization what this script does.   Keep the name short and the other boxes are optional.  Once you have filled out the first three boxes to your satisfaction hit next.  (I have had problems with names with spaces, underscored, or longer than 8 characters.)

This dialog box allows you to associate the script obtained from this Git with your toolbox.  Click on the folder browser button.
