## Configuration instructions
This script utilizes the ArcPy functions.  Shapefiles, layers, and attribute names will need to be adjusted to reflect the user’s data. 
The script is set up to be used in an ArcGIS toolbox.  Before you use the script it will need to be saved to an ArcGIS toolbox.  

###Step 1. Create toolbox
If you do not already have a personal tool box you will need to add one.  In AcrMap or ArcCatalog go to the AcrToolbox window.

This opens the browsing dialog box.  If you have a pre-existing toolbox you can add it to your map this way or brows to the location where you would like your toolbox to be stored and create a new toolbox in this location.  Use the create toolbox button at the top right hand corner of the dialog box and name the file something unique to you.
