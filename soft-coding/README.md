# Sewer Maintenance soft-coding
## Configuration instructions
This script utilizes the ArcPy functions.  Shapefiles, layers, and attribute names will need to be adjusted to reflect the user’s data. 
The script is set up to be used in an ArcGIS toolbox.  Before you use the script it will need to be saved to an ArcGIS toolbox.  

###Step 1. Create toolbox
If you do not already have a personal tool box you will need to add one.  In AcrMap or ArcCatalog go to the AcrToolbox window.

Right click on the white space and select Add Toolbox…

This opens the browsing dialog box.  If you have a pre-existing toolbox you can add it to your map this way or brows to the location where you would like your toolbox to be stored and create a new toolbox in this location.  Use the create toolbox button at the top right hand corner of the dialog box and name the file something unique to you.

###Step 2. Add script to toolbox
To add the script as a tool that can be used like any other tool in ArcMap right click on the appropriate toolbox.  Navigate to Add, hovering over Add will bring up more option.  Click on Script.

The dialog box will allow you to name the script and provide descriptive information that can be used to remind you and others in your organization what this script does.   Keep the name short and the other boxes are optional.  Once you have filled out the first three boxes to your satisfaction hit next.  (I have had problems with names with spaces, underscored, or longer than 8 characters.)

This dialog box allows you to associate the script obtained from this Git with your toolbox.  Click on the folder browser button.

 Go to the location where you saved the script from this Git and open the script.  This will return you to the Add Script window where you may hit next.

This next window is very important.  The names that are input will be displayed in the gui tool when accessed through the toolbox to guide users on what information to input.

The data type column provides a dropdown box with a large number of choices on the type of data that the code should be interacting with.

It is important that the display names and the data types are in the same order that they are called in the script found on this git.  Feel free to make the display names fit your data.

If you have correctly filled out the properties table the GUI tool interface should look like any other tool you might use in ArcMap

## Known bugs
If the date field in the routine maintenance shapefile is a string (text) the DaysSinRM field may be incorrect, because it assumes that the last routine maintenance feature added is the most recent routine maintenance.  The date field cannot currently handle alpha numeric dates like April 15, 2016.
